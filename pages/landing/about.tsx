            Neariot campaigns make ideas into reality. It&#39;s where creators
            share new visions for creative work with the communities that will
            come together to fund them.

            No matter what, creators always control how the work comes
            togetherâ€”no 100-page grant applications, no donors demanding you
            modify your message, no last-minute edits from investors. When
            backers chip in funding and help spread the word, they too become
            part of these independent works
